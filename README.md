# Week4
**Edit the README file and write a few sentences explaining why you picked the question above and what you found interesting about this dataset. Explain what your chart shows and reveals. Using appropriate Markdown code, include your image in your README file.**

I picked the question above because I truly didn't know what my answer to this would be, and wanted to get perspective. I've had long conversations that I've enjoyed, but also the most tedious/dreadful/person-can't-take-a-hint hours of torture on a plane. 

This is the chart that I came up with: [Generally speaking, is it rude to say more than a few words to the stranger sitting next to you on a plane?] (https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xz6p9/1/)

My chart (yes I originally did a pie chart and do still firmly believe it works for this dataset) (yes I also changed it to a bar chart because pie charts are--unfairly--hated) reveals what I hoped to be true, that the vast majority of respondents don't think conversations on a plane are rude. However, I'm glad that 180 of the respondents disagreed (approx. 21%) because I do believe the answer depends on the context.
